- **SQLite** database for development (easily replaceable with PostgreSQL/MySQL)
- **JWT** for authentication
- **bcryptjs** for password hashing
- **Helmet** for security headers
- **Rate limiting** for API protection

### Frontend
- **React 18** with functional components and hooks
- **React Router** for navigation

### Running the Application
1. Start the backend server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Start the frontend (in a new terminal):
```bash
npm run client
```

3. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`

## Default Credentials
- **Username**: admin
- **Password**: password

## Database Schema

### Key Tables
- **users**: User accounts and authentication
- **departments**: Academic departments
- **classrooms**: Available rooms and labs
- **faculty**: Teaching staff information
- **subjects**: Course subjects and details
- **student_batches**: Student groups by semester
- **timetables**: Generated timetable records
- **timetable_slots**: Individual class slots
- **optimization_params**: Department-specific scheduling parameters

## Optimization Algorithm

The platform uses a sophisticated optimization algorithm that considers:

### Constraints
- Faculty availability and maximum teaching hours
- Classroom capacity and availability
- Student batch schedules
- Fixed time slots (special classes)
- Working hours and break times

### Optimization Goals
- Minimize faculty workload variance
- Maximize classroom utilization
- Avoid scheduling conflicts
- Respect subject frequency requirements
- Consider faculty subject preferences

### Algorithm Features
- **Constraint Satisfaction**: Ensures all hard constraints are met
- **Genetic Algorithm Elements**: Multiple solution variations
- **Scoring System**: Evaluates solution quality
- **Conflict Resolution**: Automatic conflict detection and avoidance

## Configuration

### Optimization Parameters
Each department can configure:
- Maximum classes per day
- Working hours (start/end times)
- Lunch break timing
- Minimum break duration between classes
- Working days per week

### Security Settings
- JWT token expiration
- Rate limiting configuration
- CORS settings
- Password complexity requirements

## Deployment

### Production Build
1. Build the frontend:
```bash
cd client && npm run build
```

2. Set environment to production:
```bash
export NODE_ENV=production
```

3. Start the server:
```bash
npm start
```
